Next.js this fabulous open source framework based on React allows you to manage an entire application! Both front-end and back-end, perfect for a javascript developer and all this with high performance, but if you arrive on this article, you must surely know it, if not, hop, little link to the [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started)

**Funfact**: This blog is entirely a static site created with [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) ðŸ˜Ž

## Table of contents

**For this tutorial Node.js is required.**

- Create **Next.js** app
- Setup **AWS S3 butcket** static website
- Publish **Next.js** Application to **S3 bucket**

## Create Next.js app

As recommended by **Next.js** we will use `create-next-app` for create a project.
There are two possibilities to initialize a project:

```shell
npx create-next-app
# or
yarn create next-app
```

Then follow the instructions and finally go to our project and start it

```shell
cd my-project && yarn dev
```

The server starts up on port `3000`, so let's go to `http://localhost:3000`

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ ! now let's deploy this static **Next.js** application to **aws S3 bucket**

## Setup AWS S3 butcket static website

To continue the tutorial, we are going to move on to the aws console, for this section I am assuming you already have an AWS account with access to the management console.

1. Access your management console
2. on **Find Services**, search **S3**

![S3Service](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13301795/98572716-398f0a80-22b6-11eb-847a-8cff5fe5d392.png 'Search S3')

3. click on **Create bucket**

![createBucket](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13301795/98572713-37c54700-22b6-11eb-96a2-9a3dd530284e.png 'Create bucket')

4. enter name your Bucket name (e.g: my-awesome-nextjs-app), it must be **unique**

![addname](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13301795/98574220-f6359b80-22b7-11eb-9429-a25842f91b90.png 'add bucket name')

5. enable access public and valide by unchecking Block all public access and check the acknowledgment of receipt, you can create the bucket

![accesspublic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13301795/98574198-ed44ca00-22b7-11eb-9c60-acb054784221.png 'enable access public')

6. on list, select your bucket

![selectBucket](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13301795/98574186-eae27000-22b7-11eb-8422-b54b7ab7eca9.png 'select bucket on list')

7. go to **properties** > **Static website hosting**, select **Enable** static website hosting and **Host as static website** on **index document** and **Error document** you can ad `index.html`, Save changes

![staticWebsite](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13301795/98574156-e3bb6200-22b7-11eb-80eb-4998cc4b9394.png 'static webstite hosting')

8. Now go to **Permissions** > **Bucket policy** edit and add this, **change Ressource with your bucket name**

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": "*",
            "Action": "s3:GetObject",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::[bucket-name]/*"
        }
    ]
}
```

![bucketPolicy](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13301795/98574147-e027db00-22b7-11eb-99c2-02b5cc2153a3.png 'bucket policy')

Now you're ready to export the **Next.js** app and add this to yout bucket ðŸŽ‰

## Publish Next.js Application to S3 bucket

To complete this tutorial, we're going to export our **Next.js** app using `package.json` and import the exported app into our **S3 bucket**.

To start, we will have to modify the file `package.json` to change a build script :

```json
    "build": "next build && next export"
```

This build script build the app and generate all the static files (to folder **out**) necessary to run the application.

![appBuilded](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13301795/98650919-dd6dca00-2339-11eb-9327-aef5cd8ce328.png 'builded app')

Go to your **S3 Bucket** and upload the contents of the **out** folder

![UploadS3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13301795/98651281-5705b800-233a-11eb-84f0-266bc64a1e31.png 'upload on S3 bucket')

Click on **Upload**, after loading you can exit

![uploadedFiles](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13301795/98651923-2d995c00-233b-11eb-8d2a-b08f69a0e395.png)

To access our application, go to **Properties**> **Static website hosting** where the bucket link is displayed

![linkBucket](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13301795/98652228-9b458800-233b-11eb-8f0f-502ac84c3b0f.png)

let's go to this link :

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations** ðŸŽ‰ We have uploaded our static **Next.js** app to **aws S3 bucket**

All you have to do is code your static application, export it and add it to your bucket

## Conclusion

As you can see it is very easy to host a static **Next.js** app on aws, in the next article i think we will see how to work with github actions to use continuous integration on our **Next.js** app, so every merge on branch main your application will be updated on your bucket.
